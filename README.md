made as a project for a friend who wanted a purple discord theme but found out PurpleCord exists, so if you use this i recommend you switch over to that (https://github.com/A-Trash-Coder/PurpleCord)

# evyncord
Simple Powercord theme that resembles different shades of purple.


(evyn is the person who wanted me to make this theme, despite the name "evyncord")


(not really meant for public ues but if you want to use go ahead lol)
